See doc/ directory for documentation.

To build HTML variant of documentation you need to install sphinx document generator, easiest way to do this is to use doc/requirements.txt.

$ pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

$ cd doc/user

$ make html

After that you can start exploring documentation in doc/user/source/_build/html/ directory.
